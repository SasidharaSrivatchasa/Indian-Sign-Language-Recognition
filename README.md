# Indian-Sign-Language-Recognition
1. Introduction:-

Indian Sign Language (ISL) is a form of communication used by the deaf and hard-of-hearing community in India. This project aims to develop a deep learning model that can recognize and classify different ISL hand gestures using image processing and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs).
2. Objective:-

The primary goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that accurately predicts ISL signs based on image inputs. This can be used to enhance communication for individuals with hearing and speech impairments.
3. Dataset Description:-

•	The dataset consists of labelled images of different hand gestures representing ISL signs.

•	Preprocessing techniques such as image resizing, normalization, and augmentation were applied to improve model performance.

•	The dataset was split into training and validation sets to ensure generalization.

4. Model Architecture:-

•	The model was built using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).

•	It consists of multiple convolutional layers, pooling layers, and fully connected layers.

•	Activation functions such as ReLU and SoftMax were used for feature extraction and classification.

5. Training Process:-

•	The model was trained using Google Collab with TensorFlow and Keras.

•	Loss function: Categorical Cross-Entropy

•	Optimizer: Adam Optimizer

•	Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy and Loss

6. Results & Performance:-

•	The training and validation accuracy were monitored over multiple epochs.

•	The final model achieved an accuracy of 80% on training data and 75% on validation data.

7. Challenges & Future Improvements:-

•	Overfitting: Some minor overfitting was observed, which could be mitigated using dropout layers.

•	Dataset Limitations: Increasing the dataset size and adding more variations can improve accuracy.

•	Real-time Implementation: Future work can focus on deploying this model in a real-time application.

8. Conclusion:-

The Indian Sign Language Recognition project successfully demonstrates the application of deep learning in sign language recognition. The trained CNN model achieves promising results 
and can be further improved for real-world applications.
